# Client
## Known bugs
 - Safewalk does not work without the shift setting turned on
 - None of the "ASM" modules work... and some other stuff...

## Improved Module List
 - SafeWalk: Sneak while jump and On hold settings
 - Autoclicker: Seperate Righclick min and max cps sliders, allow eat, allow bow and different click modes (LEGIT and RAVEN) and you can make your cps higher, no sword rightclick (doesn't right click when you are holding a sword), onlyblocks (only rightclicks when you are holding blocks)
 - ChatLogger: I have a chat logger 
 - Bridge Assist: helps you aim and click during godbridging, moonwalking, ninja bridging and breezily.
 - CONFIG MANAGER!
 - Much more but I am too lazy to put it here...
